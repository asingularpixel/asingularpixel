Hi, I'm asingularpixel (though I prefer just "pixel"), and I use she/they pronouns.

I like getting technical insights into and new perspectives of my favorite games, which typically means:
- Pokemon decomps
- Minecraft mods
- Random video-gamey things

Don't worry, I do also enjoy looking into more standard projects (can't think of any examples rn but I promise I do)

I'm trying to get into actually contributing to public repos more and hopefully start some projects of my own, but for now most of my (very small) collection of repos are private.

I've been programming for around 8 years now, but I'm still kinda new to contibuting, etc. so you might have to be a little patient with me (which I apologize in advance for lol)

Enjoy looking at the two things I have public ig
